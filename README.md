# 🌦️ Weather Prediction

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes weather data to **predict whether it will rain the next day or not**.  
The dataset contains attributes such as temperature, humidity, rainfall, and other weather-related features.  

The workflow includes data cleaning, outlier detection, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and preparing the dataset for machine learning tasks.

## ⚙️ Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Handling missing values  
- Detecting and removing outliers using the **IQR method**  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations  
- Preparing dataset for machine learning  
- Building a predictive model for **Rain Tomorrow (Yes/No)**  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**  
- **Pandas, NumPy** (data processing)  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** (visualization)  
- **Scikit-learn** (machine learning)  

## 📊 Example Output

- Summary statistics of the dataset

- Visualizations (temperature trends, rainfall distribution, etc.)

- Model performance (accuracy, confusion matrix)

## 📌 Future Work
- Improve model accuracy with advanced algorithms (XGBoost, Random Forest, etc.)
